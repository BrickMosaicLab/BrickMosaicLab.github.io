# BrickPhoto
*My Brick Photo* is a web application I built over Winter 2026.

The Web app is live and being hosted with GitHub Pages

Instructions are given on the website. In simple terms, *My Brick Photo* takes a photo that you upload and then outputs a photo using 1 by 1 brick plates using a dictionary of 17 different colours pieces that can be purchased online. Some photos work better than others due to the limited colours. Hopefully you can find an intriguing result.
